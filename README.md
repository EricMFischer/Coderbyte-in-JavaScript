# Coderbyte in JavaScript

I undertook the easy Coderybyte problems, striving for the most concise and clear solutions. When I had the opportunity to employ cooler, more sophisticated methods to make my solution shorter, I took advantage of it.

To my knowledge, the solutions here are as condensed as they could be using introductory JavaScript methods. ENJOY!
