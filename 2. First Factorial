// First Factorial

// Recursion: calling a function from within itself (to rerun the function)
// It acts like a complex for loop most of the time, but it's also useful for binary searchs

function FirstFactorial(num) { 
  if( num === 1 ) {                   // Recursion needs a base case, otherwise it will go on forever 
    return 1;                         //  If num is ever 1 we break out of the recursion
  } 
  return num * FirstFactorial(num-1); // Recursion magic! To get factorials, we need something like num * num-1 ... * 1 
}                                     // So let's call FirstFactorial on all numbers below num and collect the result
